This CS131 project requires you to read a text file that includes the 
account number, name, and balance of an individual and store it in a 
linked list. From the four choices 1-4, the user is prompted to enter 
their choice.

Choice 1 displays the balance of an individual.<br/>
Choice 2 deposits money into the exisiting account.<br/>
Choice 3 withdraws money from the exisiting account.<br/>
Choice 4 displays all exisiting accounts with their names and balances.

In this repository, the text file is provided along with the actual 
program .cpp file. Additionally, there is a .gitignore file and a README 
file included as a requirement.

In order to build and run this program, you must have Visual Studios 
2015 or higher (14.0 or higher). Either use git to clone the 
repository or download the repository as a zip file to have all the 
files needed to build the program. Open Visual Studios, create a new 
empty project, then under the Solution Explorer tab, find Source Files 
tab, then right click and select Add then Exisiting item. Find where the 
files were downloaded or cloned, then for the exisiting item, open the 
.cpp file. Once the .cpp file is inside the Visual Studios project, 
scroll over Debug and click Start Without Debugging to build and run the 
program.

This is a new line.
